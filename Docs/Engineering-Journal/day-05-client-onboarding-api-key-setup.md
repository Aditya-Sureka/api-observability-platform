# 📅 Day 5 — Building the Client Service & API Key Management

## 🎯 Goal

Extend the platform by introducing client management and API key generation while following Clean Architecture principles.

Today's focus wasn't just adding new APIs—it was designing a scalable client management module that integrates seamlessly with the existing authentication system.

---

## ✅ What I Built

### Client Management

* Client onboarding
* Client user management
* Client retrieval APIs

### API Key Management

* API key generation
* API key retrieval
* API key persistence

### Architecture

* Repository Layer
* Service Layer
* Controller Layer
* Dependency Injection
* Modular Routing

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

### Repository Pattern

Repositories handle only database interactions.

### Service Layer

Business logic stays inside services rather than controllers.

### Dependency Injection

Dependencies are injected instead of being created inside classes, making the code easier to test and maintain.

### MongoDB populate()

Learned how `.populate()` resolves document references without manually writing multiple queries.

## 💡 Key Learnings

Authentication alone isn't enough.

A monitoring platform also needs a secure way for external applications to identify themselves.

API Keys provide that identity while keeping authentication and client management separate.

I also became much more comfortable following a layered architecture where every component has a clear responsibility.

## 🚀 Next Step

Start building the core monitoring engine where client applications can begin sending API monitoring data.
